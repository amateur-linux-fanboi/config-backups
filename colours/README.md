# Rosalind 

## Info

Rosalind is a light colour scheme with a pink base. 
At the cost of being slightly low contrast, it is warm-coloured.
At this time, the GUI colours are not properly configured.
That might take a bit of time, since I don't use vim in a GUI environment.

Rosalind is my first ever attempt at making a vim colour scheme, so it is constantly evolving, as and when I figure out deeper secrets of the code syntax and the intricacies of colour theory.
